Bug Tracker

You can search through the GNOME Bugzilla for existing bug reports:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=browse.html&product=pygobject

You can also file a new bug report:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=pygobject


Git Repos
---------

PyGObject itself is hosted at https://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/

In addition a GitHub organization exists which contains various related
projects: https://github.com/pygobject


Continuous Testing
------------------

The test suite gets regularly run on all supported platforms using
https://github.com/pygobject/pygobject-ci

There is currently no integration with bugzilla/git.gnome.org for this and the
status has to be checked manually.
