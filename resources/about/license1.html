<br>
<br> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br>     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
<br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br> the version number 2.1.]
<br>
<br>                            Preamble
<br>
<br>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br>
<br>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
<br>below.
<br>
<br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br>these things.
<br>
<br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br>
<br>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br>
<br>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br>
<br>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br>introduced by others.
<br>
<br>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br>
<br>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br>libraries into non-free programs.
<br>
<br>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br>the library.
<br>
<br>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br>special circumstances.
<br>
<br>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
<br>becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
<br>be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br>
<br>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br>system.
<br>
<br>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br>that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br>
<br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br>be combined with the library in order to run.
<br>
<br>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br>
<br>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br>Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br>
<br>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br>
<br>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br>included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br>
<br>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br>compilation and installation of the library.
<br>
<br>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br>and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br>
<br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br>Library.
<br>
<br>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br>fee.
<br>
<br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br>
<br>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br>
<br>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br>
<br>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br>
<br>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br>    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br>    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br>
<br>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br>    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br>
<br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br>it.
<br>
<br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br>collective works based on the Library.
<br>
<br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br>the scope of this License.
<br>
<br>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br>these notices.
<br>
<br>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br>
<br>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br>the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br>
<br>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br>medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br>
<br>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br>
<br>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br>
<br>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br>
<br>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br>
<br>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br>Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br>
<br>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br>
<br>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br>engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br>
<br>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br>of these things:
<br>
<br>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br>    to use the modified definitions.)
<br>
<br>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br>
<br>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
<br>    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
<br>    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
<br>    performing this distribution.
<br>
<br>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br>    specified materials from the same place.
<br>
<br>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br>
<br>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br>the executable.
<br>
<br>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br>distribute.
<br>
<br>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br>
<br>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br>    Sections above.
<br>
<br>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br>
<br>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br>
<br>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br>the Library or works based on it.
<br>
<br>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br>this License.
<br>
<br>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br>
<br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br>apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br>circumstances.
<br>
<br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br>integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br>impose that choice.
<br>
<br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br>
<br>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br>countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br>
<br>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br>
<br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br>the Free Software Foundation.
<br>
<br>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br>and reuse of software generally.
<br>
<br>                            NO WARRANTY
<br>
<br>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br>
<br>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

<br>
<br>           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br>
<br>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
<br>of the ordinary General Public License).
<br>
<br>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
<br>It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
<br>effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
<br>have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
<br>notice is found.
<br>
<br>
<br>    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br>    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

<br>
<br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br>
<br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
<br>your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
<br>if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<br>     claims:
<br>          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br>          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
<br>          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
<br>          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
<br>          as part of a Larger Work; and
<br>
<br>          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
<br>          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
<br>          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
<br>          Original Code (or portions thereof).
<br>
<br>          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
<br>          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
<br>          Original Code under the terms of this License.
<br>
<br>          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
<br>          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
<br>          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
<br>          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the

<br>
<br>          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br>          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
<br>          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
<br>          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
<br>          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
<br>          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br>
<br>          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or

<br>          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
<br>          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
<br>          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
<br>          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of

<br>          the Covered Code.
<br>
<br>          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
<br>          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
<br>          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
<br>          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
<br>          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
<br>          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
<br>          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
<br>          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
<br>          that Contributor.
<br>
<br>3. Distribution Obligations.
<br>
<br>     3.1. Application of License.
<br>     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
<br>     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
<br>     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
<br>     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
<br>     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
<br>     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
<br>     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
<br>     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
<br>     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
<br>     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
<br>     Section 3.5.
<br>
<br>     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
<br>     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
<br>     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
<br>     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
<br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
<br>     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
<br>     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
<br>     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
<br>     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
<br>     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
<br>     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
<br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
<br>
<br>     3.3. Description of Modifications.
<br>     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
<br>     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
<br>     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
<br>     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
<br>     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
<br>     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
<br>     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
<br>     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
<br>
<br>     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
<br>          (a) Third Party Claims.
<br>          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
<br>          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
<br>          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
<br>          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
<br>          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
<br>          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
<br>          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
<br>          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
<br>          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
<br>          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
<br>          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
<br>          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
<br>          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
<br>
<br>          (b) Contributor APIs.
<br>          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
<br>          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
<br>          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
<br>          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
<br>
<br>               (c)    Representations.
<br>          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
<br>          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
<br>          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
<br>          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
<br>          this License.
<br>
<br>     3.5. Required Notices.
<br>     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
<br>     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
<br>     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
<br>     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
<br>     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
<br>     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
<br>     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
<br>     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
<br>     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
<br>     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
<br>     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
<br>     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
<br>     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
<br>     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
<br>     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
<br>     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
<br>     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
<br>     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
<br>
<br>     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<br>     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
<br>     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
<br>     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
<br>     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
<br>     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
<br>     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
<br>     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
<br>     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
<br>     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
<br>     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
<br>     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
<br>     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
<br>     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
<br>     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
<br>     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
<br>     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
<br>     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
<br>     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
<br>     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
<br>     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
<br>     terms You offer.
<br>
<br>     3.7. Larger Works.
<br>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
<br>     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
<br>     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
<br>     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
<br>
<br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
<br>
<br>     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br>     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
<br>     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br>     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br>     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
<br>     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
<br>     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
<br>     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
<br>     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
<br>     understand it.
<br>
<br>5. Application of this License.
<br>
<br>     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
<br>     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
<br>
<br>6. Versions of the License.
<br>
<br>     6.1. New Versions.
<br>     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
<br>     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
<br>     will be given a distinguishing version number.
<br>
<br>     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
<br>     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
<br>     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
<br>     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
<br>     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
<br>     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
<br>     Covered Code created under this License.
<br>
<br>     6.3. Derivative Works.
<br>     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
<br>     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
<br>     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
<br>     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
<br>     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
<br>     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
<br>     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
<br>     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
<br>     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
<br>     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
<br>     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
<br>     this License.)
<br>
<br>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<br>
<br>     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
<br>     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
<br>     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
<br>     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
<br>     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
<br>     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
<br>     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
<br>     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
<br>     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<br>
<br>8. TERMINATION.
<br>
<br>     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
<br>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
<br>     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
<br>     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
<br>     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
<br>     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
<br>     shall survive.
<br>
<br>     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
<br>     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
<br>     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
<br>     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
<br>
<br>     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
<br>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
<br>     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
<br>     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
<br>     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
<br>     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
<br>     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
<br>     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
<br>     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
<br>     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
<br>     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
<br>     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
<br>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
<br>     the 60 day notice period specified above.
<br>
<br>     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
<br>     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
<br>     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
<br>     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
<br>     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
<br>     Participant.
<br>
<br>     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
<br>     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
<br>     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
<br>     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
<br>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
<br>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
<br>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
<br>     license.
<br>
<br>     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
<br>     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
<br>     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
<br>     prior to termination shall survive termination.
<br>
<br>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br>
<br>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
<br>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
<br>     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
<br>     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
<br>     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
<br>     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
<br>     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
<br>     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
<br>     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
<br>     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
<br>     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
<br>     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
<br>     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
<br>     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br>
<br>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<br>
<br>     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
<br>     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
<br>     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
<br>     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
<br>     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
<br>     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
<br>     rights set forth herein.
<br>
<br>11. MISCELLANEOUS.
<br>
<br>     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
<br>     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br>     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br>     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
<br>     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
<br>     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br>     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
<br>     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
<br>     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
<br>     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
<br>     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
<br>     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
<br>     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
<br>     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
<br>     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
<br>     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
<br>     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
<br>     License.
<br>
<br>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<br>
<br>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
<br>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
<br>     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
<br>     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
<br>     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
<br>     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
<br>
<br>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
<br>
<br>     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
<br>     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
<br>     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
<br>     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
<br>     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
