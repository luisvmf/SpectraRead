<br>
<br>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
<br>==========================
<br>
<br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
<br>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
<br>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
<br>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
<br>
<br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
<br>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
<br>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
<br>software.
<br>
<br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
<br>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
<br>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
<br>Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
<br>Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
<br>non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
<br>Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
<br>the PSF.
<br>
<br>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
<br>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
<br>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
<br>the various releases.
<br>
<br>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
<br>                    from                                compatible? (1)
<br>
<br>    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
<br>    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
<br>    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
<br>    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
<br>    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
<br>    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
<br>    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
<br>    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
<br>    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
<br>    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
<br>    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
<br>
<br>Footnotes:
<br>
<br>(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
<br>    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
<br>    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
<br>    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
<br>    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
<br>
<br>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
<br>    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
<br>    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
<br>    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
<br>
<br>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
<br>direction to make these releases possible.

<br>
<br>* The original design for the ``.egg`` format and the ``pkg_resources`` API was
<br>  co-created by Phillip Eby and Bob Ippolito.  Bob also implemented the first
<br>  version of ``pkg_resources``, and supplied the OS X operating system version
<br>  compatibility algorithm.
<br>
<br>* Ian Bicking implemented many early "creature comfort" features of
<br>  easy_install, including support for downloading via Sourceforge and
<br>  Subversion repositories.  Ian's comments on the Web-SIG about WSGI
<br>  application deployment also inspired the concept of "entry points" in eggs,
<br>  and he has given talks at PyCon and elsewhere to inform and educate the
<br>  community about eggs and setuptools.
<br>
<br>* Jim Fulton contributed time and effort to build automated tests of various
<br>  aspects of ``easy_install``, and supplied the doctests for the command-line
<br>  ``.exe`` wrappers on Windows.
<br>
<br>* Phillip J. Eby is the seminal author of setuptools, and
<br>  first proposed the idea of an importable binary distribution format for
<br>  Python application plug-ins.
<br>
<br>* Significant parts of the implementation of setuptools were funded by the Open
<br>  Source Applications Foundation, to provide a plug-in infrastructure for the
<br>  Chandler PIM application.  In addition, many OSAF staffers (such as Mike
<br>  "Code Bear" Taylor) contributed their time and stress as guinea pigs for the
<br>  use of eggs and setuptools, even before eggs were "cool".  (Thanks, guys!)
<br>
<br>* Since the merge with Distribute, Jason R. Coombs is the
<br>  maintainer of setuptools.  The project is maintained in coordination with
<br>  the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) and the larger Python community.
